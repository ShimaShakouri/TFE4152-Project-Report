# TFE4152-Project-Report

This is the final report for the project of the course TFE4152 (Design of Integrated Circuits), autumn 2021, NTNU.

In this project we focus on the design of a four-pixel digital camera. 
The design is divided into two parts: 

The analog part, which uses pixel sensors that
consists of a photogate circuit, a three-stage comparator, and
an 8-bit dynamic memory. In this part, the analog signal will
be received and transformed into digital. 

The digital part, which consists of the control circuit that controls the pixel
array and all the input signals of the pixel sensors.
